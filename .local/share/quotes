In that volume, he promised a second if the first should prove acceptable. We forgive him the first collection because he did not inflict another.	Charles Spurgeon
Zaha Hadids Maxxi Museum is proof that Rome and contemporary architecture are no longer a paradox. The building is characteristic Hadid - with curving lines and organic shapes - and the permanent collection already boasts works by Francesco Clemente, William Kentridge, and Gerhard Richter.
